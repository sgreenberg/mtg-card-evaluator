Ugin, Eye of the Storms
AI Rating: 5
Pro Rating: 5
He comes down, exiles your opponent's best permanent and then stats drawing you cards and gaining you life. His loyalty is massive, so taking him down is not easy, and the card advantage he grants is absurd.


Anafenza, Unyielding Lineage
AI Rating: 5
Pro Rating: 5
Flash makes it a lot easier for you to successfully set up an Endure trigger. Just set up any trade and flash in Anafenza, and you come out way ahead -- and then she sticks around and gives you more value. She has pretty solid starting stats too!


Arashin Sunshield
AI Rating: 1
Pro Rating: 2
This has mediocre stats, a mediocre enters ability, and a mediocre activated ability. It is nice that you got all of that from one card, and the tap ability can have it's moments, but overall this isn't a card you're ever going to be very excited about playing.


Bearer of Glory
AI Rating: 3.2
Pro Rating: 2.5
This is a solid two drop that can attack well early thanks to first strike, and in the late game it can buff your whole board.


Clarion Conqueror
AI Rating: 4.6
Pro Rating: 3
This is mostly a three mana 3/3 Flyer -- but that's pretty good! Keep in mind the effect is symmetrical. The times where it does shut off your opponent's stuff will feel great. But not so much when you have an ability you want to use.


Coordinated Maneuver
AI Rating: 2.6
Pro Rating: 2.5
This is a serviceable removal spell, especially in Abzan and Mardu, since they are so good at making tokens.


Dalkovan Packbeasts
AI Rating: 4.2
Pro Rating: 3
A three mana 0/4 with Vigilance isn't good -- but getting three 1/1 attackers every turn is, especially because there are so many good ways to take advantage of them in the format. If your opponent doesn't have big enough stuff to take the Packbeasts down, it's going to be a real problem for them.


Descendant of Storms
AI Rating: 3.7
Pro Rating: 3
This feels pretty good on one, and can even fill your curve on two if you don't have a two drop. It's attack ability helps keep it at least a little interesting all game too.


Dragonback Lancer
AI Rating: 2.9
Pro Rating: 2
4-mana 3/3 flyers aren't what they once were, and while adding Mobilize to the mix helps, this is still a very underwhelming creature.


Duty Beyond Death
AI Rating: 3.3
Pro Rating: 1.5 // 3.0
If you have lots of Mobilize this is at it's best, since Mobilize tokens are temporary anyway -- and buffing your whole board and making it indestructible is pretty strong when you aren't actually giving something up.


Elspeth, Storm Slayer
AI Rating: 4.9
Pro Rating: 5
This is the biggest bomb in the set. She can easily kill you with tokens or counters, and even if you're behind she kills something and threatens to start doing token and counter things next turn.


Fortress Kin-Guard
AI Rating: 3.2
Pro Rating: 3.5
This is an excellent common. A two mana 1/2 that makes a 1/1 is an excellent rate, and this has another mode!


Furious Forebear
AI Rating: 3
Pro Rating: 2.5
This'll trigger pretty often, but I don't think you'll have two spare mana around often enough for it to be nuts -- it's the kind of thing you start getting back late for some nice value, though.


Lightfoot Technique
AI Rating: 1.5
Pro Rating: 2.5
This is a nice trick -- it blanks removal, can often win combat, and has the upside of sending something to the sky to swing in for lethal -- or block a dragon out of nowhere.


Loxodon Battle Priest
AI Rating: 3
Pro Rating: 3.5
Getting a counter every turn adds up quickly, and this can start the turn it comes down.


Mardu Devotee
AI Rating: 1.7
Pro Rating: 3
This does so much for one mana. It's a body that blocks Mobilize tokens, it filters your mana, and it Scries. The Scry helps it maintain relevance when you draw it late, too.


Osseous Exhale
AI Rating: 3.3
Pro Rating: 3
This is a little bit narrow, and aggro decks won't love that a creature gets to block before they can use this, but it is reasonably efficient and will gain you life sometimes.


Poised Practitioner
AI Rating: -0
Pro Rating: 1.5
It feels like every set we get a three mana 2/3 with an effect that gives it a counter when you do something, and they've all been bad. They just have such a bad baseline, that it's really frustrating to jump through hoops for them.


Rally the Monastery
AI Rating: 3.8
Pro Rating: 3
Casting this for 4 is acceptable because it has three very useful modes -- and casting it for two is amazing, and super doable.


Rebellious Strike
AI Rating: 1.8
Pro Rating: 1.5 // 2.5
If you aren't trying to trigger Prowess or Flurry, this isn't all that good. It gives a small buff and replaces itself, but that buff doesn't always do something meaningful. If you are in on flurry or prowess, it gets significantly better.


Riling Dawnbreaker
AI Rating: 3
Pro Rating: 3
This effectively fills two different spots on the curve which is great. It's not gonna feel amazing on two or 5, but it can do both serviceably, and that's a big deal.


Sage of the Skies
AI Rating: 5
Pro Rating: 5
Even if you only ever got a three mana 2/3 with Flying and lifelink, this would be a 3.5, but you're going to be able to get two copies often enough for this to be a bomb.


Salt Road Packbeast
AI Rating: 3.5
Pro Rating: 4
This is an excellent common. Paying the base cost isn't a disaster, and it will virtually always cost a lot less while generating a nice 2-for-1.


Smile at Death
AI Rating: 4.6
Pro Rating: 1.5
It just seems too hard to set this up, especially because it's a 5 mana do-nothing the turn it comes down.


Starry-Eyed Skyrider
AI Rating: 3.8
Pro Rating: 2.5
The stat-line's pretty ugly, but giving flying to other things -- including mobilize tokens, does enough to make up for that.


Static Snare
AI Rating: 4.2
Pro Rating: 3.5
Paying 5 for this 100% of the time would be like a 2.0, but this will typically cost less. Keep in mind it counts attacking creatures either player controls.


Stormbeacon Blade
AI Rating: 2
Pro Rating: 1.5
This will feel good when it works out, but the baseline is pretty bad.


Stormplain Detainment
AI Rating: 3.6
Pro Rating: 3
As usual, Banishing Light-like cards are pretty good in Limited. It's not the most efficient thing ever and it's Sorcery speed, but it can hit any nonland.


Sunpearl Kirin
AI Rating: 3.8
Pro Rating: 4
A two mana 2/1 with Flash and Flying is already playable, and this has massive upside. As usual the bounce effect can save a creature or rebuy an "enters" trigger, but in this case you can also give up a Mobilize token to draw a card, which is pretty sweet.


Teeming Dragonstorm
AI Rating: 4
Pro Rating: 3
Casting this only once feels fine, and it won't be unusual to get to cast it again later in the game.


Tempest Hawk
AI Rating: 1.2
Pro Rating: 1.5
Wind Drakes are pretty mediocre these days, and this one has to get in for you to get another copy -- and in a set with lots of efficient flyers, I don't see that happening enough.


United Battlefront
AI Rating: 2.7
Pro Rating: 0
This is way too narrow for Limited. Your deck won't have enough nonland permanents with mana value 3 or less for you to consistently hit even one card with it, much less two.


Voice of Victory
AI Rating: 4.6
Pro Rating: 3
A two mana 1/3 with Mobilize 2 is a pretty nice rate, and that's most of where this card's value comes from. Although, it's nice knowing that your tricks can't be blown out when this is in play.


Wayspeaker Bodyguard
AI Rating: 3.2
Pro Rating: 2.5
It feels like this enters trigger will usually give you something back, and the Flurry trigger will be nice in aggro decks.


Aegis Sculptor
AI Rating: 2.5
Pro Rating: 3
A 4-mana 2/3 with Flying and Ward 2 isn't great, but if you even get one counter on it, you're going to feel pretty good about things -- and that seems eminently doable.


Agent of Kotis
AI Rating: 1.8
Pro Rating: 2
This has mediocre base stats, but the Renew ability is going to give you nice value in the late game.


Ambling Stormshell
AI Rating: 4.9
Pro Rating: 4.5
This is a massive road block that your opponent can't just ignore, and because of Ward they will never destroy it efficiently. It can protect you when it has to, and then turn into a turtle Ancestral Recall once you feel like you can attack. It's likely the cards you draw let you add to the board, making up for it being tapped.


Bewildering Blizzard
AI Rating: 2.7
Pro Rating: 2.5
This seems like a surprisingly legit draw spell. Debuffing your opponent's stuff makes up for you not adding to the board when you spend 6 mana.


Constrictor Sage
AI Rating: 3.1
Pro Rating: 3
Without Renew this is pretty solid, and with it this can provide a really nice effect out of the graveyard.


Dirgur Island Dragon
AI Rating: 2.9
Pro Rating: 2.5
This is two 1.5 cards stapled together -- but having an Omen does mean that this doesn't have the biggest downside about being a 6-drop -- that it doesn't do anything until you get to 6!


Dispelling Exhale
AI Rating: 3.4
Pro Rating: 2.5
This is a solid counterspell normally, and a pretty good one when you can Behold.


Dragonologist
AI Rating: 5
Pro Rating: 3.5
This is a powerful card selection effect that will virtually always hit something, and it gets particularly spicy when you hit a dragon.


Dragonstorm Forecaster
AI Rating: 2
Pro Rating: 0.0 / 1.5
This can grab two cards that you probably shouldn't play in this format. Even drawing bad cards can be okay, but spending two generic to do it is pretty rough. Even if you have a couple card to draw with it, I think it maxes out at a 1.5.


Essence Anchor
AI Rating: 1.6
Pro Rating: 1.5 / 3.5
An artifact that Surveils every upkeep isn't really worth this much mana, but if you have some ways to move cards out of your graveyard (and there are plenty of those) this turns into a very good value engine.


Focus the Mind
AI Rating: 2
Pro Rating: 2.5
Casting this for 5 is pretty rough, but I think you'll be able to spend 3 often enough for it to be a soli draw spell.


Fresh Start
AI Rating: 3.1
Pro Rating: 1.5
This type of removal is rarely good because it doesn't deliver a card worth of value. After all, what you put it on can still block -- and if it had high toughness, that's going to feel particularly brutal.


Highspire Bell-Ringer
AI Rating: 0.6
Pro Rating: 2.5
This has solid base stats and is a pretty good enabler for Flurry.


Humbling Elder
AI Rating: 0.7
Pro Rating: 3
Other cards like this have performed quite well. You'd be surprised how often you can flash this in and just kill something while keeping the Elder. It's also super cheap in a color where that really matters.


Iceridge Serpent
AI Rating: 1.5
Pro Rating: 2.5
It's a tiny bit overcosted, but it's still a fairly relevant body that subtracts from your opponent's board.


Kishla Trawlers
AI Rating: 3.4
Pro Rating: 2.5
I don't love that this asks for two separate card types to be in your graveyard for it to do anything, but it's true that when it can get something back it'll feel pretty powerful.


Marang River Regent
AI Rating: 5
Pro Rating: 5
Just the dragon side is a 4.5-level card. It adds a huge scary body to the board and subtracts from the opponent's board in a big way -- but throw in the fact that you can cast this earlier in the game to draw some cards and it's even more amazing.


Naga Fleshcrafter
AI Rating: 4.5
Pro Rating: 4.5
Clones that can copy any creature always perform super well, because they'll always be the best creature on the board -- and the Renew ability has a fine baseline of buffing something, and sometimes it'll be downright absurd.


Ringing Strike Mastery
AI Rating: 0.4
Pro Rating: 2
It's frustrating that this kind of gets irrelevant in long games, but being a super cheap removal spell seems useful alongside Flurry.


Riverwalk Technique
AI Rating: 1.2
Pro Rating: 3
We see this card all the time without the counter mode, and it's always at least a 2.5, and often better. So, throw in the fact that this can be bad Negate in a pinch, and this looks like a quality card.


Roiling Dragonstorm
AI Rating: 4
Pro Rating: 2.5
The baseline here is sort of acceptable, and I think in most games you'll get to cast it a second time.


Sibsig Appraiser
AI Rating: 3.1
Pro Rating: 4
This is an absurd common. A three mana 2/1 that just draws you a card would be a very good Common -- but this is way better, because it gives you selection and loads your graveyard.


Snowmelt Stag
AI Rating: 1.4
Pro Rating: 1.5
It's kind of cool that this has a fluctuating stat-line, and that it can be good with Harmonize -- but spending 4 mana on a 5/2 is terrible, and that's what this is half the time. Your opponent will be able to spend 1-2 mana to kill it with ease, and that's brutal.


Spectral Denial
AI Rating: 2.3
Pro Rating: 3
This is a very nice counterspell because it scales all game long, and it can even be super efficient at times.


Stillness in Motion
AI Rating: 1.6
Pro Rating: 0
This basically does nothing in Limited. There are self-mill decks in the format to be sure, but a card that only does that is a liability.


Taigam, Master Opportunist
AI Rating: 5
Pro Rating: 2.5
He gives you card advantage -- but only in the long run. Waiting several turns to get that card is kind of a pain after you already jumped through hoops to double spell in the first place.


Temur Devotee
AI Rating: -0
Pro Rating: 2.5
This is a solid defensive creature that helps filter your mana, and those two things go together pretty well.


Unending Whisper
AI Rating: 1.7
Pro Rating: 2.5
This gives you a 2-for-1 in the long run, and it's a cheap draw spell to help you get Flurry going.


Ureni's Rebuff
AI Rating: 2.8
Pro Rating: 2.5
Without Harmonize this wouldn't be great -- it's a bad Unsummon. But adding Harmonzie to the mix changes the equation in a big way, since you'll often cast it twice.


Veteran Ice Climber
AI Rating: 2.7
Pro Rating: 3.5
Even without the attack trigger this would be a quality card, and with it you can not only load your graveyard with sweet value -- you can find cards with Renew to buff this unblockable creature.


Wingblade Disciple
AI Rating: 3.8
Pro Rating: 3.5
While I don't love the baseline here, even just getting a single 1/1 flyer out of it is going to feel great.


Wingspan Stride
AI Rating: 0.5
Pro Rating: 1.5
This buff is pretty good for the cost, and the fact it can bounce is kind of sweet with Flurry and Prowess -- but it's still a card that risks a 2-for-1, and I don't think it does enough to offset that.


Winternight Stories
AI Rating: -0
Pro Rating: 2.5
This is a decent draw spell that gets a lot better thanks to Harmonize -- if this format is slow it might be insane, but if it's a typical format it's probably just solid because it never adds to the board.


Abzan Devotee
AI Rating: 2.3
Pro Rating: 2.5
This has the worst stat-line of all the devotees, but it's fixing you have access to even when you mill it.


Adorned Crocodile
AI Rating: 1.1
Pro Rating: 3
This seems like a lot of value for the cost. The stat-line isn't great obviously, but it's great against removal and can trade for most stuff while giving you lots of extra value.


Aggressive Negotiations
AI Rating: 1.4
Pro Rating: 1.5
Three mana for a discard spell (even one that exiles) is just too much for most formats. It only adds minimally to the board.


Alchemist's Assistant
AI Rating: 3.2
Pro Rating: 3
A two mana 2/1 with lifelink is already playable, and getting lifelink out of your graveyard is pretty sweet.


Alesha's Legacy
AI Rating: 1.1
Pro Rating: 2.5
This is a solid trick since it saves a creature from most removal and allows a creature to win virtually any combat.


Avenger of the Fallen
AI Rating: 4.6
Pro Rating: 4
When this can't Mobilize super well it's a good defensive creature, and when it can mobilize lots of tokens it's a frightening attacker. Your opponent has to give something up to kill it because of death touch too, and that's not always easy against a 2/4.


Caustic Exhale
AI Rating: 4
Pro Rating: 4
If this always cost 2 mana it'd be a great removal spell, but it will cost one mana reasonably often -- at which point it's absurd.


Corroding Dragonstorm
AI Rating: 2.1
Pro Rating: 2.5
This has a pretty solid base effect, and recasting it even once is going to feel like you're doing something sweet.


Cruel Truths
AI Rating: 1.2
Pro Rating: 2
This lets you see a lot of cards, but it's a little expensive for drawing 2 and not adding to the board.


Delta Bloodflies
AI Rating: 1.4
Pro Rating: 2
If you can play this on two and put counters on it or your other stuff, it can chip in for a lot of damage -- but it's going to get outclassed by dragons pretty quickly.


Desperate Measures
AI Rating: 2.3
Pro Rating: 1.5 // 3.5
If you have lots of Mobilize, this becomes a one mana draw 2 which is great -- and it has lots of other modes too.


Dragon's Prey
AI Rating: 3.6
Pro Rating: 3
Costing more against Dragons is a very real downside in this set, but it does a decent job against everything else.


Feral Deathgorger
AI Rating: 2
Pro Rating: 2.5
Neither of these cards is great individually, but Dusk Sight replaces itself and impacts the board, and the Deathgorger isn't a completely terrible 6-drop. It can trade with most dragons and will cause problems for any that have less than 5 power, while also hating on the graveyard -- or helping you trigger your own stuff.


Gurmag Rakshasa
AI Rating: 3.1
Pro Rating: 4
This enters trigger will often kill something and make one of your creatures into a much better attacker for a turn, and then you have a 5/5 Menace that your opponent likely just can't ignore.


Hundred-Battle Veteran
AI Rating: 2.5
Pro Rating: 4
A 4-mana 4/2 is usually pretty bad, but this one can be cast from the graveyard once -- and that's already a 2-for-1. Throw in the fact it'll be a 6/6 sometimes, something that is more likely when you bring it back since it brings a Finality counter with it.


Kin-Tree Nurturer
AI Rating: 2.9
Pro Rating: 3.5
A three mana 2/1 with lifelink that makes a 1/1 is a good card, and this has flexibility beyond that.


Krumar Initiate
AI Rating: 2.8
Pro Rating: 3
This is a little clunky to be sure, but it can make a whole lot of tokens -- or one big one, and that can help you take over a game.


Nightblade Brigade
AI Rating: 1.6
Pro Rating: 2.5
A three mana 1/3, even with death touch -- isn't great, but it comes with two other little pieces of value that help it out. Death touch + mobilize is a real pain for your opponent, and Surveil 1 can really help you out.


Qarsi Revenant
AI Rating: 4.6
Pro Rating: 5
This is Vampire Nighthawk on steroids, even before we talk about the Renew ability! Once you add Renew to the mix, it's going to produce 2-for-1s with regularity -- either that, or just outright kill your opponent. There's basically no good outcome for your opponent when this thing hits the table.


Rot-Curse Rakshasa
AI Rating: 4.2
Pro Rating: 3
This is a super weird card, but I think it's pretty nice. It has trouble really adding to the board, even once you factor in Renew -- but it seems flexible enough. You can spend lots of mana to make your opponent unable to block, or a little mana to turn it into a bad removal spell.


Salt Road Skirmish
AI Rating: 3.6
Pro Rating: 3
4 mana for sorcery-speed destroy target creature isn't great -- but adding two temporary tokens to the board is a very real upgrade. Between the removal and those new bodies, you're likely to have a much better combat than your opponent expected.


Sandskitter Outrider
AI Rating: 1.1
Pro Rating: 3.5
Getting a 2/1 with menace and a 2/2 for 4 mana is a good deal, and Endure's flexibility can give you a 4/3 Menace instead when that's what you need.


Scavenger Regent
AI Rating: -0
Pro Rating: 5
Even if this was always a dragon it'd be pretty good, since it's efficient and your opponent can't remove it without getting 2-for-1'd, but throw in the fact that this can be a sweeper when that's what you need, and this looks excellent.


The Sibsig Ceremony
AI Rating: 2
Pro Rating: 0
There's just no way to get this going in Limited. Youl would need every creature in your deck to either be very cheap or have an enters or death trigger, and that's not happening.


Sidisi, Regent of the Mire
AI Rating: 3.7
Pro Rating: 1.5
It's tough to make this activated ability do anything meaningful. Giving up something on board for a creature that might be slightly better isn't very appealing, and even making that line up in the first place is challenging.


Sinkhole Surveyor
AI Rating: 4.6
Pro Rating: 5
This is a two drop that can take over the game quickly. Spitting out 1/1s is nice, but it's also great it can grow itself, because it makes it more likely it can keep attacking and triggering endure. Things will snowball and get out of hand if it's not dealt with.


Strategic Betrayal
AI Rating: 3
Pro Rating: 3
Exiling graveyards matters in a big way in this format, and two mana edicts are usually playable to begin with.


Unburied Earthcarver
AI Rating: 1
Pro Rating: 2
I think this activated ability is a little bit too expensive to be easily accessible on most turns.


Unrooted Ancestor
AI Rating: 1.9
Pro Rating: 3
A three mana 3/2 isn't great, even with Flash -- but gaining indestructibility is no small thing, and will allow this to wreck many attacks -- while being a scarier attacker itself. It gets even better with Mobilize.


Venerated Stormsinger
AI Rating: 3.3
Pro Rating: 3
Draining 1 life for every mobilize token is amazing, and this will do a lot more than that. It also counts itself, so it'll usually at least drain 1 life as a fail case.


Wail of War
AI Rating: 2.4
Pro Rating: 2.5
The second mode on this card usually makes for a playable card in Limited, but it can be awkward because it's only good later. So it's great they gave this a mode that can be useful in the early game for picking off X/1s.


Worthy Cost
AI Rating: 2.1
Pro Rating: 2.0 // 3.5
This set has tons of tokens, so making this a servicable removal spell is pretty doable -- and in decks with lots of Mobilize, it might just be your best removal spell.


Yathan Tombguard
AI Rating: 3
Pro Rating: 3
Black has lots of counters in this set, so drawing cards with this isn't a pipe dream. It's even a good place to put counters in the first place thanks to Menace.


Breaching Dragonstorm
AI Rating: 2.5
Pro Rating: 1.5
Most of the time you won't hit something worth 5 mana. It does get sweet if you hit a dragon, though -- as you'll cast it and put the storm back in your hand. That'll feel great, but the rest of the time? It'll be pretty awful.


Channeled Dragonfire
AI Rating: 3.5
Pro Rating: 3.5
Sorcery-speed Shock is already pretty good, but you can cast this twice.


Cori-Steel Cutter
AI Rating: 4.8
Pro Rating: 4
The equipment without Flurry is kind of passable, and with it, it's amazing. Just one token will feel like you're getting a steal, and more than that will feel amazing.


Devoted Duelist
AI Rating: 1.2
Pro Rating: 1.5
This is super underwhelming. The Flurry trigger is weak and the stat-line is bad. If you need a two drop, you'll play it -- but only if you don't have something better. And hopefully you do.


Dracogenesis
AI Rating: 2.5
Pro Rating: 0
Omniscience is terrible in Limited, and this is worse. Once you spend this mana you don't really need to be able to put things into play for free.


Equilibrium Adept
AI Rating: 3.3
Pro Rating: 4
Even withotu Flurry this would be a card you play 100% of the time because it generates such a nice 2-for-1, and when this has double strike it'll be incredibly difficult to block.


Fire-Rim Form
AI Rating: 2.5
Pro Rating: 1.5
This is an okay trick. It lets lots of creatures win combat, but it's not good against removal, and while the buff it leaves behind is okay, it's not great.


Fleeting Effigy
AI Rating: 2.8
Pro Rating: 1.5
This is supposed to enable Flurry, but it seems to me there are way better ways to do that than a creature who is never on the battlefield during your opponents turn, and one that takes a ton of mana just to be able to trade when it attacks.


Iridescent Tiger
AI Rating: 2.4
Pro Rating: 2
This'll be great when you can slam another spell with the mana it produces. Problem is, you won't be able to do that all that often.


Jeskai Devotee
AI Rating: 1.3
Pro Rating: 2.5
This fiexes your mana well and can threaten to be a 3/3 when it attacks, allowing it to get through and/or trade reasonably well.


Magmatic Hellkite
AI Rating: 4.6
Pro Rating: 4
This has great stats and the format has enough non-basic lands for the trigger to be relevant when you play it on turn 4. It does have diminishing returns the later the game gets, though.


Meticulous Artisan
AI Rating: 2.2
Pro Rating: 2
I don't love th starting stat-line, but it does fix and ramp your mana, and any time it attacks your opponent has to take into account the fact that it might grow.


Molten Exhale
AI Rating: 4.3
Pro Rating: 4
Even if this was Sorcery-speed 100% of the time it'd be a very good card. Two mana for 4 damage is a great rate and you can trade up, sometimes in a big way. So, the fact that this'll be an instant a significant chunk of the time is amazing.


Narset's Rebuke
AI Rating: 2.7
Pro Rating: 2
5 mana for 5 damage is pretty bad. It's just hard to feel good about spending that much mana to remove most creatures, but the exile clause is nice, and if you can spend the three mana it gives you on something you'll feel pretty good. Most of the time, you won't be able to make use of the mana though.


Overwhelming Surge
AI Rating: 3.5
Pro Rating: 3
Three mana for 3 damage on an Instant is pretty good -- though not great. This will occasionally nab you a 2-for-1 though, which is nice.


Rescue Leopard
AI Rating: 1.4
Pro Rating: 2
This is here to enable Harmonize, but I'm a little skeptical you want to play a creature with very mediocre stats and a rummage trigger.


Reverberating Summons
AI Rating: 1.3
Pro Rating: 1.5
This won't do anything much of the time, and by the time you can make it into a 3/3, it's probably not that scary. It's nice that you can throw it away for more cards, though.


Sarkhan, Dragon Ascendant
AI Rating: 4.8
Pro Rating: 4
I think getting this and a dragon in your opening hand is going to happen reasonably often, and when that's true this card will feel great between the treasure it gives you and the dragon that will buff Sarkhan. The baseline is fine, too.


Seize Opportunity
AI Rating: 1
Pro Rating: 2.5
The trick mode is great when it lines up correctly, and when it doesn't you have a pretty good draw spell for Red -- one likely to help with Flurry.


Shock Brigade
AI Rating: 3.3
Pro Rating: 2.5
This feels pretty good on turn two, and Menace means it can produce a token in many situations.


Shocking Sharpshooter
AI Rating: 4
Pro Rating: 3.5
This stat-line + Reach has performed well of-late, and this format is very much geared towards this triggered ability. Red decks will have no shortage of ways to generate multiple bodies.


Stadium Headliner
AI Rating: 5
Pro Rating: 3.5
On turn one this can threaten to do tons of damage, and when it reaches a point where it can't attack any more, it turns into a removal spell -- one that it helps make better, since you can make a mobilize token before you use it.


Stormscale Scion
AI Rating: 4.7
Pro Rating: 3
If you can't get a second copy of this, it's not very good. It will maybe be buffing one other thing if you're lucky, and be way below rate. However, getting two copies of it seems pretty doable -- keep in mind it counts your opponent's spells too!


Stormshriek Feral

The Omen is good at getting Flurry going, and the creature -- while not amazing, does come with Haste so it can often get in for damage before your opponent takes it down.


Summit Intimidator
AI Rating: 1.4

This trigger can be really good when you're the beat down and curving out. But it can also be useless if you're at parity or behind.


Sunset Strikemaster
AI Rating: 3.9
Pro Rating: 4
This red mana dork is sweet, as it can help with your mana in a big way. Dropping 4-drops when your opponent only has 3 mana is sweet -- and once you don't really need mana anymore, it can take down dragons.


Tersa Lightshatter
AI Rating: 5
Pro Rating: 4
The stats are solid and the enters trigger is a pretty great way to dig deeper in your deck for better cards -- throw in it's attack trigger, and you have a very powerful creature.


Twin Bolt
AI Rating: 1.8
Pro Rating: 3
Dividing damage is a big deal. Killing two X/1s with this feels great, and you can also use it to Shock your opponent, or do 1 to a creature and 1 to your opponent.


Underfoot Underdogs
AI Rating: 3
Pro Rating: 2.5
This activated ability isn't great, but the baseline of a three mana 1/2 and a 1/1 is fine. The ability may also play better in a format with lots of low-power Mobilize creatures.


Unsparing Boltcaster
AI Rating: 2.7
Pro Rating: 3
It feels like you'll be able to set this up to do 5 without too much trouble, thanks to mobilize. When you can, it'll feel great -- and when you can't, you won't feel terrible about a three mana 3/3.


War Effort
AI Rating: 3.2
Pro Rating: 2
Just the buff and a 1/1 every turn isn't really worth a card most of the time -- but if you've gone wid enough, that buff gets much better.


Wild Ride
AI Rating: 0.9
Pro Rating: 1
Sorcery-speed buffs that don't help toughness are pretty underwhelming.


Zurgo's Vanguard
AI Rating: 3
Pro Rating: 2.5
This'll often have pretty high power, and it can help raise it's own power thanks to Mobilize.


Ainok Wayfarer
AI Rating: 2.5
Pro Rating: 2.5
This'll set up your graveyard and help you hit a land drop reasonably often, and sometimes a 1/1 with a counter is what you want too.


Attuned Hunter
AI Rating: 2.7
Pro Rating: 3
This has a passable baseline and getting even one counter on is doable -- and it'll feel pretty good.


Bloomvine Regent
AI Rating: 5
Pro Rating: 4.5
A 5 mana 4/5 with flying that gains you 3 life when it enters is a very good Limited card. Gives you something substantial and threatening while gaining you life, and that's a good way to stabilize. It also ramps your mana super well early, and can gain more than just those 3 life, so it's great.


Champion of Dusan
AI Rating: 2.3
Pro Rating: 2.5
The stat-line's pretty ugly, even with trample -- but this offers a pretty efficient buff from the graveyard.


Craterhoof Behemoth
AI Rating: 4.8
Pro Rating: 3.5
There's enough ramp in this format for this to be a real win condition, but it will still get stuck in your hand a little bit too often to be a bomb.


Dragon Sniper
AI Rating: 3.9
Pro Rating: 3
This can trade for anything -- even dragons -- and it can even attack without giving up that ability.


Dragonbroods' Relic
AI Rating: 2.9
Pro Rating: 1.5 // 3.5
This is an almost adequate mana rock, and the token it makes it the late game is pretty amazing. If you don't have amazing mana, it's not very good -- but if you can use the activated ability, you'll be pretty happy with this.


Dusyut Earthcarver
AI Rating: 1.7
Pro Rating: 3
6 mana for a 4/4 with Reach and a 3/3 is awesome, and if you just one one big body it can do that for you.


Encroaching Dragonstorm
AI Rating: 3
Pro Rating: 2.5
Fixing is important in this format, and ramp looks real enough in Green for this to be solid.


Formation Breaker
AI Rating: 3
Pro Rating: 3
Putting counters on this can be sweet since it becomes bigger and so much harder to block.


Herd Heirloom
AI Rating: 4.8
Pro Rating: 4
This gives you some pretty legitimate ramp and fixing, and can even become a value engine in the late game.


Heritage Reclamation
AI Rating: 1.1
Pro Rating: 2
This has enough modes that it isn't terrible, but if you're mostly using the exile mode it probably isn't great.


Inspirited Vanguard
AI Rating: 3.8
Pro Rating: 4
The baseline here is basically a 5-mana 3/2 and a 2/2, but it's so much better than that -- not only because it can just be one big creature, but also because endure keeps triggering when it attacks. So it can grow itself, or spit out more tokens -- either way, you're going to feel good about things.


Knockout Maneuver
AI Rating: 3.9
Pro Rating: 3
This is a nce removal spell for Green, and the counter has extra value in this format.


Krotiq Nestguard
AI Rating: 1
Pro Rating: 1.5
This can enable 4+ power payoffs and it's good with Harmonize, but it's a little too one dimensional.


Lasyd Prowler
AI Rating: 5
Pro Rating: 4.5
This has good stats and can help you load your graveyard in a big way, and it's Renew ability is capable of adding a huge number of counters to your board.


Nature's Rhythm
AI Rating: 3.1
Pro Rating: 1.5
This is just too clunky and expensive for Limited. Your deck isn't going to have sweet tool box creatures and the like -- it's going to have a bunch of Limited creatures, so overpaying for them isn't exactly amazing.


Piercing Exhale
AI Rating: 2.9
Pro Rating: 3.5
This effect is great at instant speed, since you need to find a window when it's safe to cast -- otherwhise you risk a 2-for-1, and an instant can obviously be cast in a wider variety of situations than a Sorcery can. Also, when you do get to surveil with this it'll feel amazing.


Rainveil Rejuvenator
AI Rating: 2.8
Pro Rating: 2.5
The stats aren't great, but this goes well in mill and ramp strategies, which seem to be there for the taking in Green.


Rite of Renewal
AI Rating: 1.7
Pro Rating: 2
You can use this to win longer games by getting your two best permanent decks, and the other effect can disrupt the opponent or be used to shuffle your best cards back into your deck.


Roamer's Routine
AI Rating: 1.3
Pro Rating: 2.5
Spending three mana and not adding to the board is a little scary, but this gives you ramp and fixing in a format where that looks like what you want to be doing -- and it can ultimately generate a 2-for-1.


Sage of the Fang
AI Rating: 3.5
Pro Rating: 3
The baseline here -- a three mana 3/3 -- is pretty decent, and it can go wild if you have more counters.


Sagu Pummeler
AI Rating: 2.5
Pro Rating: 2.5
This has good stats, and while it's Renew ability is a bit pricy, it is likely to make one of your creatures far more relevant.


Sagu Wildling
AI Rating: 2.6
Pro Rating: 3
The Omen would probably be a playable card in this set on it's own since it's a nice way to fix. And while the creature isn't amazing, the life gain does make sure you get something out of it no matter what.


Sarkhan's Resolve
AI Rating: 0.7
Pro Rating: 2
Plummet or a medium trick is what you get here, and if you're in the market for either of those, it's not bad.


Snakeskin Veil
AI Rating: 2.6
Pro Rating: 3
This is a super annoying trick that blanks removal super efficiently while leaving behind a very real buff, and it can even do the job in combat.


Sultai Devotee
AI Rating: 2.9
Pro Rating: 2.5
This fixes mana well, and it can trade for anything once it's outlived it's usefulness.


Surrak, Elusive Hunter
AI Rating: -0
Pro Rating: 4
Surrak makes sure your opponent can't use removal spells without regretting it in a big way, and he's a pretty heavy hitter.


Synchronized Charge
AI Rating: 3.2
Pro Rating: 3
The base form of this card is very solid, and Harmonizing it late is likely to have a big impact on the board in a format with lots of counters.


Trade Route Envoy
AI Rating: 2.3
Pro Rating: 3.5
This is such a good Common, no matter which mode you get. If you get a 4-mana 5/4 that helps with token synergy -- fine, and if you get a 4-mana 4/3 that draws you a card -- great!


Traveling Botanist
AI Rating: 4.3
Pro Rating: 3.5
This has nice stats and this trigger is pretty sweet. You either draw a card or Surveil 1, and I'm happy with either.


Undergrowth Leopard
AI Rating: 1.2
Pro Rating: 2
This has an okay baseline, and occasionally it'll turn into Naturalize.


Warden of the Grove
AI Rating: 4.8
Pro Rating: 5
This will end the game in a few turns if you can't deal with it. Not only does it grow, it also makes all of your creature spells way better.


All-Out Assault
AI Rating: 4.2
Pro Rating: 4
This buff is enough to make almost any creature into a significant presence on the board, and in a format with Mobilize it looks especially spicy. The extra combat step isn't always meaningful, though.


Armament Dragon
AI Rating: 3.6
Pro Rating: 4
This will shift the board in a big way every time you cast it. At worst it's a 6/7 flyer, and most of the time you don't have to put all of your eggs in one basket.


Auroral Procession
AI Rating: 2.1
Pro Rating: 2
This is a pretty underwhelming rate to get one card back from the graveyard, even with payoffs for doing so.


Awaken the Honored Dead
AI Rating: -0
Pro Rating: 4
Most of the value here comes from the first chapter, but it's pretty sweet you get a bunch of extra stuff after casting a good removal spell.


Barrensteppe Siege
AI Rating: 4.5
Pro Rating: 4.5
The Abzan mode will very quickly upgrade your board, and the Mardu mode can be good when you have lots of tokens and sacrifice stuff going on.


Betor, Kin to All
AI Rating: 4.7
Pro Rating: 5
It won't be hard for this to draw a card the turn it comes down. After all, it contributes 7 toughness -- so you just need three more to get there. And this is a huge dragon that can threaten to draw you even more cards on subsequent turns.


Bone-Cairn Butcher
AI Rating: 3.3
Pro Rating: 4
Giving your tokens -- especially the Mobilize ones -- death touch is nasty, and the baseline here is pretty good.


Call the Spirit Dragons
AI Rating: 1.8
Pro Rating: 0
Even in this format, I dont' think you're getting there with this. The mana is tough and so is the set up.


Cori Mountain Stalwart
AI Rating: 3.8
Pro Rating: 3
This has a passable baseline and even flurrying once with it in play is pretty nice.


Death Begets Life
AI Rating: -0
Pro Rating: 2
This is really strong when you can cast it, but the problem is even when you do, you...might draw your entire deck in Limited.


Defibrillating Current
AI Rating: 3.4
Pro Rating: 3.5
This is a pretty nice removal spell whether you spend 3 or 4 to cast it.


Disruptive Stormbrood
AI Rating: 4.3
Pro Rating: 3.5
The Omen here is a good removal spell, so it's nice it can sometimes be a dragon + Naturalize.


Dragonback Assault
AI Rating: 4.8
Pro Rating: 5
This landfall trigger is absurd, especially in the aftermath of a card that wipes away much of the board.


Dragonclaw Strike
AI Rating: 2.9
Pro Rating: 3.5
This will allow you to remove a creature in most situations and then smash in with a huge augmented creature.


Effortless Master
AI Rating: 2.3
Pro Rating: 3
When this is a 4-mana 6/5 with Vigilance and Menace it'll feel great -- and the baseline is fine too.


Eshki Dragonclaw
AI Rating: 5
Pro Rating: 3.5
It's pretty hard to trigger this, but one trigger is more than enough when a creature has this good of a baseline.


Fangkeeper's Familiar
AI Rating: -0
Pro Rating: 4
This can generate a 2-for-1 in most scenarios and provide all kinds of disruption.


Felothar, Dawn of the Abzan
AI Rating: 4.2
Pro Rating: 3.5
If you have expendable tokens -- like you know, those with Mobilize - Felothar is going to be very strong.


Flamehold Grappler
AI Rating: 4.2
Pro Rating: 3.5
When you can copy a spell with this it's going to feel great, and you'll never feel bad about having a 3/3 with First Strike.


Frontline Rush
AI Rating: 3.3
Pro Rating: 3.5
If you've already gone wide this is a great trick, and if you haven't, it can help you do it.


Frostcliff Siege
AI Rating: -0
Pro Rating: 3
Both of these modes really require you to have a significant board to do something meaningful, and need for you to be ahead to really get going.


Glacial Dragonhunt
AI Rating: 3.8
Pro Rating: 3
It's hard to be upset with a removal spell you can cast twice, and this one can also just be used to draw a card in a pinch.


Glacierwood Siege
AI Rating: 2.5
Pro Rating: 1
Neither of these modes is very meaningful in Limited. Milling your opponent out is possible, though difficult to achieve -- and playing lands from the graveyard is almost entirely relevant.


Gurmag Nightwatch
AI Rating: 1.1
Pro Rating: 2
This gives you a bit of card selection and loads the graveyard, but it's hard enough to cast for three and inefficient enough at 4 that I don't think it looks great.


Hardened Tactician
AI Rating: 3
Pro Rating: 4
This is one of the best payoffs for Mobilize, as turning those tokens into actual cards is insane -- and it works with Endure, too.


Hollowmurk Siege
AI Rating: 4.3
Pro Rating: 5
That Abzan mode is an absolute beating that will snowball in a hurry and result in your opponent taking tons of damage -- and if you're in a spot where you need to dig deeper into your library and have lots of counter stuff, you can choose the other mode.


Host of the Hereafter
AI Rating: 3.7
Pro Rating: 3.5
If it's alone, it's a 4-mana 4/4 that lets you put two counters on something when it dies, but it helps all your other counter cards, too.


Inevitable Defeat
AI Rating: 5
Pro Rating: 3.5
It's not the most efficient removal ever, but adding a lightning helix to the mix goes a long way towards making this card worth the mana.


Jeskai Brushmaster
AI Rating: 2.4
Pro Rating: 4
A 4-mana 2/4 with just double strike would be good, but with Prowess in the mix blocking -- or not blocking -- this thing is an absolute nightmare.


Jeskai Revelation
AI Rating: 4.8
Pro Rating: 5
It's tough not to win when you cast this. It gives you something comparable to a 4-for-1 since it adds to your board, subtracts from your opponents in the big way, gains you a ton of life, and gives you extra cards.


Jeskai Shrinekeeper
AI Rating: 3.7
Pro Rating: 3
If you can get in with this right away it'll feel pretty good. Problem is, the stat-line is very bad and other dragons in the set at the same mana value -- or cheaper -- are going to outclass it.


Karakyk Guardian
AI Rating: 4
Pro Rating: 3
This creature is mostly all stats, but having hexproof until it damages something is nice and means that it can usually get in for a hit before they can kill it. Just don't block a mobilize token with it.


Kheru Goldkeeper
AI Rating: 3.4
Pro Rating: 3.5
This is inefficient as a creature, but it's going to be able to pay you back with treasure -- and it's Renew ability can make almost any creature into a threat.


Kin-Tree Severance
AI Rating: 3.6
Pro Rating: 3.5
This'll always feel like a pretty good deal since you can usuall trade up.


Kishla Skimmer
AI Rating: 3.8
Pro Rating: 3.5
Drawing cards with this is very doable, and it has a good stat-line too. Basically it can get in early, and in the late game it turns into a value engine.


Kotis, the Fangkeeper
AI Rating: 2.9
Pro Rating: 3
You kind of have to be buffing this for it to be worth it, but the good news is Kotis is ready made for Renew counters.


Lie in Wait
AI Rating: 3.4
Pro Rating: 4
This is a very powerful 2-for-1, and while it isn't always going to be online, it won't be too difficult to get it there either.


Lotuslight Dancers
AI Rating: 3.4
Pro Rating: 4
The idea here is to search up cards with Harmonize or Renew -- and the Dancers is pretty good with both mechanics thanks to it's large lifelink body.


Mammoth Bellow
AI Rating: 3.6
Pro Rating: 4
This gives you two 5/5s, and that's quite the two for one. The first token can help you Harmonize the second one.


Mardu Siegebreaker
AI Rating: 4.6
Pro Rating: 4
The exile effect here is especially good when you have a creature with an "enters" or death trigger, but it also gets good with token payoffs.


Marshal of the Lost
AI Rating: 3.7
Pro Rating: 3
The stat-line here is rough, but this does offer a buff the turn it comes down, provided you can attack.


Monastery Messenger
AI Rating: 0.9
Pro Rating: 2
This is not card advantage, just selection -- and while that's a decent effect, it certainly isn't amazing. Even at three mana this is kind of underwhelming.


Narset, Jeskai Waymaster
AI Rating: 3.4
Pro Rating: 3
Her ability can help you reload your hand late -- I mean, once you're in topdeck mode on turns when you draw a spell, she basically draws you a card each time. She's pretty mediocre earlier in the game though when you don't really want to discard.


Neriv, Heart of the Storm
AI Rating: -0
Pro Rating: 4
The stats are great, and this upgrades all of your mobilize tokens -- as well as any creature with Haste.


New Way Forward
AI Rating: 3.4
Pro Rating: 1
This is too reactive. There will be times where it's insane of course -- but there will also be times where it's useless or effectively useless, and those'll be more common.


Perennation
AI Rating: 4.4
Pro Rating: 4
It's expensive and needs some set up, but almost no matter what you reanimate, you're going to get a great deal here. I mean, even a 2/2 with hexproof and indestructible is sort of passable, and you're usually going to do way better.


Purging Stormbrood
AI Rating: 4.1
Pro Rating: 3.5
You'll cast the trick early when it's good -- which'll be pretty often -- and in the late game you get a pretty sweet dragon.


Rakshasa's Bargain
AI Rating: 3.2
Pro Rating: 3
This is a really good draw spell, especially when you only pay three. It loads up the graveyard and gives you a 2-for-1.


Rediscover the Way
AI Rating: -0
Pro Rating: 3
It's a little slow and it never adds to the board, but it gives you lots of value for three mana.


Reigning Victor
AI Rating: 2

The enters trigger often gives you a nice attack, and a creature with Mobilize is exactly what you want in Mardu.


Reputable Merchant
AI Rating: 1.1
Pro Rating: 2.5
Even at 4 this isn't terribly inefficient, as it gives you 4/4 worth of stats in the long run.


Revival of the Ancestors
AI Rating: 4.8
Pro Rating: 4
This adds to the board in a big way up front, does it even more with Chapter II, and then takes advantage of everything it added to the board.


Riverwheel Sweep
AI Rating: 2.2
Pro Rating: 2
The base effect here has not performed well in Limited in the past -- as in, most of them have been 1.0 or so -- but the fact that this replaces itself makes a big difference, especially with Flurry.


Roar of Endless Song
AI Rating: 4.4
Pro Rating: 5
5 mana for two 5/5s is nuts, and chapter III will just end the game in most situations. Even if you just have those two elephants, that turn is going to be scary for your opponent -- and you'll usuall have more.


Runescale Stormbrood
AI Rating: 3.7
Pro Rating: 3
You'll fire this off as a counterspell when you have the mana up and a target, but most of the time you're casting this as a medium dragon.


Severance Priest
AI Rating: 3.2
Pro Rating: 3
This disrupts your opponent in a big way, and death touch + the effect makes it so your opponent can never come out ahead in terms of cards.


Shiko, Paragon of the Way
AI Rating: 4.8
Pro Rating: 5
You'll virtually always have a spell to cast with this, which gives you a 2-for-1 up front -- and will trigger everythign with Flurry. And after that you have a huge dragon.


Skirmish Rhino
AI Rating: 2.9
Pro Rating: 3
Baby Siege Rhino is definitely pretty good -- draining life is really strong in Limited since it alters races in such a big way.


Songcrafter Mage
AI Rating: 3.9
Pro Rating: 4
This is going to feel like a better Snapcaster Mage in many situations since it can help you cast the things it gives Harmonize too. Sometimes it won't have anything in the graveyard to target, though.


Sonic Shrieker
AI Rating: 4.3
Pro Rating: 4
Whether you drain your opponent's life and make them discard, or kill one of their creatures and gain 2, the investment here is very much worth it since it's a 2-for1.


Stalwart Successor
AI Rating: 3.4
Pro Rating: 3
This payoff is pretty solid, but the stat-line isn't.


Temur Battlecrier
AI Rating: 4.1
Pro Rating: 3
This will reduce the cost of spells all on it's own, but it's the kind of effect that has diminishing returns the longer the game goes on.


Temur Tawnyback
AI Rating: 2.3
Pro Rating: 3
I'm reasonably happy paying 4 for this, and paying 3 for it will feel great. Looting is super good in Limited, especially when there are two graveyard mechanics.


Teval, Arbiter of Virtue
AI Rating: 5
Pro Rating: 4
It's a little bit dangerous, but being able to cast spells on the cheap and getting a huge lifelink dragon will mostly offset the downside.


Thunder of Unity
AI Rating: 4.5
Pro Rating: 3
This never adds to the board on it's own, but presumably the cards it draws you will help you add to the board on subsequent turns and the drain life effect is nuts with Mobilize.


Twinmaw Stormbrood
AI Rating: 4.5
Pro Rating:

Ureni, the Song Unending
AI Rating: 4.8
Pro Rating: 4.5
Casting this will win you the game virtually every time, and there's enough ramp around for this to be castable -- but it will get stuck in your hand sometimes.


Whirlwing Stormbrood
AI Rating: 3.9
Pro Rating:

Windcrag Siege
AI Rating: 5
Pro Rating: 4.5
Getting a free token every turn adds up in a hurry, and if you have a bunch of Mobilize on the board, the Mardu mode is likely to do a ton of work.


Yathan Roadwatcher
AI Rating: 3.8
Pro Rating: 4.5
This'll usually have something to reanimate, and paying 4 mana for a 3/3 + something that costs 2 or 3 mana is going to feel like a great deal.


Zurgo, Thunder's Decree
AI Rating: 3.8
Pro Rating: 4
This is a very real upgrade to your mobilize, and Zurgo even comes with it.


Abzan Monument
AI Rating: 2.4
Pro Rating: 3
This is great at fixing your mana early and then can give you a real presence on board late. The Monuments all give you nice 2-for-1s, and I think that makes up for them not adding to the board on turn two.


Boulderborn Dragon
AI Rating: 1.9
Pro Rating: 1.5
If you're really desperate for a dragon this can...kind of do the job.


Dragonfire Blade
AI Rating: 4.6

You'll be able to equip this for 3 or 2 pretty easily, and anything with three colors can be equipped for only one mana, and the buff it offers is pretty legit.


Dragonstorm Globe
AI Rating: 3.4

It takes an unusual format for a three mana mana rock that doesn't add to the board to be worth it, and I don't think this is that kind of format.


Embermouth Sentinel

This is better than most versions of this card since it can legit be a 2-for-1 when you have a dragon.

Mox Jasper

Kishla Village

Maelstrom of the Spirit Dragon
