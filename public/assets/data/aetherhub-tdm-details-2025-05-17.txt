This is a massive road block that your opponent can't just ignore, and because of Ward they will never destroy it efficiently.

I think getting this and a dragon in your opening hand is going to happen reasonably often, and when that's true this card will feel great between the treasure it gives you and the dragon that will buff Sarkhan. The baseline is fine, too.

If you can't get a second copy of this, it's not very good. It will maybe be buffing one other thing if you're lucky, and be way below rate. However, getting two copies of it seems pretty doable -- keep in mind it counts your opponent's spells too!

A 5 mana 4/5 with flying that gains you 3 life when it enters is a very good Limited card. Gives you something substantial and threatening while gaining you life, and that's a good way to stabilize. It also ramps your mana super well early, and can gain more than just those 3 life, so it's great.

The baseline here is basically a 5-mana 3/2 and a 2/2, but it's so much better than that -- not only because it can just be one big creature, but also because endure keeps triggering when it attacks.

This has bad stats and a mediocre enters trigger. You'll play it in your graveyard decks when you're desperate.

Having a land that turns into a card-drawing engine in the late game is pretty great, especially when this won't enter tapped all that often.

This is pretty close to being a Plains with upside, and the upside is legit.

This is really good at fixing your mana, though I would value it slightly less than the gainlands.

In other 3-color formats, the tri-lands are worth pretty high picks because they make your mana so much better.

Turning stuff into your graveyard into on-board presence is exactly what you want to be doing in the late game when you're flooding out.

Surveil doesn't quite net you a card like some of the other lands in this cycle, but it does improve your draws and load your graveyard which can really help in the late game.

Pro Rating: 1.5
This'll hurt your mana more than it will help, and even when you tutor up a bomb with the Maelstrom, you're paying a pretty serious tax to do it.
