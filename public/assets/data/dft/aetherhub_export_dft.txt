Air Response Unit
AI Rating: 2.2
Pro Rating: 2.5
This is easy to crew and quite good on offense and defense.


Alacrian Armory
AI Rating: 2.4
Pro Rating: 1.0 // 2.5
This is a little bit too all on in the Mounts/Vehicles thing to consistently be good, but in the right deck it's a solid inclusion.


Basri, Tomorrow's Champion
AI Rating: 4.3
Pro Rating: 4
He's great on turn one, and once he can't attack any more he spits out a nice token every other turn. The cycling mode won't come up a ton in Limited, but it's upside on an already very powerful card.


Brightfield Glider
AI Rating: 2
Pro Rating: 2
This is pretty hard to saddle for a medium upgrade, and the baseline isn't great.


Brightfield Mustang
AI Rating: 1.5
Pro Rating: 2
It's nice that this is easy to saddle, but even with the buff, it frequently won't have a good attack on turn 5.


Broadcast Rambler
AI Rating: 2.1
Pro Rating: 3
This brings a long a way to crew it, and getting two artifacts with one card has some legit upside in the format.


Bulwark Ox
AI Rating: 4.6
Pro Rating: 4
This is going to be tough to beat when it drops on turn two, because it can put counters on itself. And there are enough other counters in the format for the sacrifice ability to be relevant, too.


Canyon Vaulter
AI Rating: 2.8
Pro Rating: 3
This is one of the best ways to crew or saddle, as sending things into the air is a massive upgrade for no mana, and it has a solid baseline too.


Cloudspire Captain
AI Rating: 4.1
Pro Rating: 3.5
The set has enough Mounts and Vehicles for this to frequently offer a legit buff, and it can crew or mount almost everything in the set.


Collision Course
AI Rating: 2.3
Pro Rating: 3
There are enough artifacts in the set for that mode to be useful pretty often, and when it isn't, you have a mediocre removal spell you can use.


Daring Mechanic
AI Rating: 1.4
Pro Rating: 2
The baseline's alright, but the activated ability is too expensive to be used reliably.


Detention Chariot
AI Rating: 3.7
Pro Rating: 4
Adding a big vehicle to the board while exiling your opponent's best creature or vehicle is a big swing, and you can even cycle this early when you need to. It's even possible to bring it back ahead of schedule.


Gallant Strike
AI Rating: 3.7
Pro Rating: 3
This has a target a decent chunk of the time, and when it does it's a great deal. When it doesn't, you can cycle it away.


Gloryheath Lynx
AI Rating: 4
Pro Rating: 4
The efficiency is incredible. You'd play this even if it couldn't be saddled, and if you can even get one Plains out of this you come out way ahead.


Guardian Sunmare
AI Rating: 4.7
Pro Rating: 4.5
It's tough to Saddle, but attacking with this once gives you an excellent trigger, and Ward makes it hard for your opponent to ever deal with it efficiently.


Guidelight Synergist
AI Rating: 2.7
Pro Rating: 2.5
Many White decks, and especially Blue/White, will have enough artifacts for this to hit reasonably hard.


Interface Ace
AI Rating: 1.6
Pro Rating: 1.5
This set has lots of mounts and vehicles for sure, but this is still too one-dimensional. It basically can't do anything but crew and mount them, and I don't think that's enough.


Leonin Surveyor
AI Rating: 2.2
Pro Rating: 3
This is hard to block for much of the game, which means it's good at building speed, and it often turns into a 2-for-1 in the late game.


Lightshield Parry
AI Rating: 1.2
Pro Rating: 1.5
This is a mediocre trick, and while cycling makes it better, two generic to cycle isn't exciting either.


Lightwheel Enhancements
AI Rating: 1.3
Pro Rating: 1.5
The buff might help you get in for a hit and raise your speed, but it's pretty mediocre overall. Once you get to max speed it gets kind of sweet, but it's less likely getting the buff out of the graveyard by that stage is relevant.


Lotusguard Disciple
AI Rating: 2
Pro Rating: 3
This enters trigger is an absolute beating. It'll virtually always gain you some life and get a free attack in.


Nesting Bot
AI Rating: 3.3
Pro Rating: 3.5
Starting your engines on turn one is big, and the baseline here is excellent -- you always play a one mana 1/1 that leaves behind a 1/1.


Perilous Snare
AI Rating: 4.8
Pro Rating: 4.5
This is a great removal spell, and once you have Max Speed it also turns into a pretty amazing value engine. A free counter every turn is massive.


Pride of the Road
AI Rating: 3.3
Pro Rating: 2.5
The baseline is solid, and the max speed pay off is enough to make almost anything into a threat -- including the Pride itself.


Ride's End
AI Rating: 3.4
Pro Rating: 3
Paying 5 for this is not what you want to be doing, but paying two is great. If you're an aggressive deck it's far less good, but it pulls it's weight in many decks.


Roadside Assistance
AI Rating: 2.1
Pro Rating: 3
This buff offers you some very real value upfront, as lifelink is a great way to shift a race in your favor. Throw in the fact that this gives you a token, and you can overcome most of the downsides Auras have.


Salvation Engine
AI Rating: 5
Pro Rating: 4
It's tough to crew, but in many decks it'll offer an immediate buff, and if it ever attacks you're going to be in an incredible position.


Skyseer's Chariot
AI Rating: 4
Pro Rating: 3
"Crew" is an activated ability, so you'll often have something in play to name when you play this. Sometimes you won't, but it's a decent vehicle on it's own.


Spectacular Pileup
AI Rating: 4.4
Pro Rating: 4
Sweepers can be super awkward in Limited, since if you're at parity or ahead they aren't very good -- but there's really nothing else that can pull you ahead from behind the same way. You can always cycle this when you don't need it.


Spotcycle Scouter
AI Rating: 1.4
Pro Rating: 2.5
The Scry trigger is pretty nice on turn two, and while this isn't the most intimidating vehicle, it's big enough to trade off for something.


Sundial, Dawn Tyrant
AI Rating: 3.3
Pro Rating: 3
It's a vanilla creature, but it's got good stats, it's good at crewing, and it's an artifact -- and those last two things really matter in this format.


Swiftwing Assailant
AI Rating: 1.6
Pro Rating: 2
The baseline isn't very good, but if you're good at getting to max speed, it become a bit more palatable.


Tune Up
AI Rating: 2
Pro Rating: 1.0 / 2.0
The ceiling here is pretty high, and there is some graveyard stuff going on in this format -- including vehicles with Cycling. If you have enough of them, this can perform well. But it's also a dead card a little bit too often.


Unswerving Sloth
AI Rating: 2.9
Pro Rating: 3.5
Once you can get to 4 power for saddle, you can send this in every turn essentially for free -- since it untaps itself and everything else and gains indestructible. It's a very problematic attacker.


Valor's Flagship
AI Rating: 5
Pro Rating: 5
This is tough to beat when it's on the battlefield, and it gets around it's only downside -- it's expensive -- by having a powerful Cycling ability that can give you a bunch of bodies.


Voyager Glidecar
AI Rating: 4.3
Pro Rating: 4
This gives you so much for so little. Even without the ability I'd play this for one mana pretty happily, and the ability means it can remain relevant all game long by growing and going into the sky.


Voyager Quickwelder
AI Rating: 2.6
Pro Rating: 2.5
Reducing the cost of artifacts certainly comes up in this format, especially in Blue/White. But it is the kind of card you sort of need to get in play on turn three, or it has diminishing returns.


Aether Syphon
AI Rating: 3.2
Pro Rating: 0
This is just too slow to ever be worthwhile. Drawing cards is nice, but not when you have to spend this much for it, and while it has Max Speed, it doesn't help you get it at all.


Bounce Off
AI Rating: 2.7
Pro Rating: 2
You usually go down a card with this, but it does offer some nice tempo with the upside of occasionally blowing out a combat trick or a crewed vehicle.


Caelorna, Coral Tyrant
AI Rating: 2.3
Pro Rating: 0
This just isn't worth a card, high toughness or not. You don't want a card this one-dimensional.


Diversion Unit
AI Rating: 3.4
Pro Rating: 3
This has a nice baseline as a two mana 2/1 flyer with nice typing, and sometimes it can help keep your bigger threats alive.


Flood the Engine
AI Rating: 3.4
Pro Rating: 2.5
This type of removal is never great because it's a little too expensive and a little too easy for your opponent to deal with.


Gearseeker Serpent
AI Rating: 2.1
Pro Rating: 1.5 // 3.0
If you're a heavy artifact deck (most likely UW) this is good. If you're not, it's too tough to get a deal on it.


Glitch Ghost Surveyor
AI Rating: 1.4
Pro Rating: 2
The Wind Drake stat-line is pretty bad, and while it helps you with Speed a little bit and can eventually be a 2-for-1, this card doesn't quite overcome that mediocre baseline.


Guidelight Optimizer
AI Rating: 2
Pro Rating: 2.5
Tapping for mana for artifacts and Exhaust abilities is pretty sweet, and the fact this is an artifact itself really makes it a solid Common.


Howler's Heavy
AI Rating: 2.4
Pro Rating: 2.5
Cycling this is going to be "Plan A" most of the time since it generates a decent amount of value for the cost, and can even sometimes give you a 2-for-1. But, running this out as a 4-mana 3/4 when you have to is nice.


Hulldrifter
AI Rating: 2.3
Pro Rating: 3
This has pretty bad stats for a vehicle that is this hard to crew, but drawing two cards up front is definitely a big deal.


Keen Buccaneer
AI Rating: 2.5
Pro Rating: 3
Even if this was always 5-mana for a 3/4 with Vigilance that loots when it enters, it'd be solid -- and this is way better since you can pay in installments.


Memory Guardian
AI Rating: 3
Pro Rating: 3
Even casting this for 4 feels pretty good, and if you can go lower it feels even better.


Midnight Mangler
AI Rating: 2.3
Pro Rating: 2
Not a terrible defensive card, but it doesn't belong in all decks.


Mindspring Merfolk
AI Rating: 4.5
Pro Rating: 3
Not a lot of Merfolk in this set, but an Exhaust ability capable of drawing this many cards is pretty powerful.


Mu Yanling, Wind Rider
AI Rating: 4.9
Pro Rating: 5
The vehicle token is already worth a card more or less, and she can quite easily draw you even more cards. You'll often get a 3-for-1 when she comes down, and then the value just keeps rolling from there.


Nimble Thopterist
AI Rating: 2.8
Pro Rating: 3.5
Blue creatures that make a token are very frequently the best Common in Limited, and this is definitely in the conversation. You get good stats for what you pay and the artifact upside is nice.


Possession Engine
AI Rating: 4.6
Pro Rating: 4
Even though this nerfs the creature you steal, it's still basically a 5-mana 5/5 vehicle that removes a creature, and the creature you steal can probably crew the Engine -- and might even have some abilities.


Rangers' Refueler
AI Rating: 3.8
Pro Rating: 3.5
It's great that this is an enabler and a payoff, so you can draw a card with it even without any other Exhaust, and you're going to have other Exhaust around, too.


Repurposing Bay
AI Rating: 2.6
Pro Rating: 0
This is way too finnicky about what you sacrifice and what you can search up to ever be worth it in Limited. You just can't do something meaningful with this. Playing it is a good way to lose.


Riverchurn Monument
AI Rating: 4.2
Pro Rating: 0 / 3.0
This is terrible in most decks, but if you're in a graveyard-oriented control deck, it's a legitimate mill win condition.


Roadside Blowout
AI Rating: 3.4
Pro Rating: 3.5
Even if this always cost three mana it would be good, since you can get some nice tempo while drawing a card, so the fact this'll be one mana sometimes is really nice.


Sabotage Strategist
AI Rating: 3.4
Pro Rating: 2
If this can stick around, it's very powerful. But it is a horrible stat-line that means it can die to multiple one mana and two mana removal spells in the format, and that is just too big of a blowout for this to be anything special.


Scrounging Skyray
AI Rating: 4
Pro Rating: 1.5 // 4.0
This is an amazing discard/cycling payoff that can completely run away with the game, and you can't say that about most two drops. You do need lots of discard and cycling to get there, but it's very doable in Blue.


Skystreak Engineer
AI Rating: 2.7
Pro Rating: 2
This will never feel especially efficient, but it's nice that it feels fine on turn two and you can Exhaust it late to keep it relevant.


Slick Imitator
AI Rating: 2.6
Pro Rating: 2.5
Blue isn't great at getting to max speed, and while that max speed ability can be really great, you also give up a card to get a copy of something so it isn't like it's insane either.


Spectral Interference
AI Rating: 2.2
Pro Rating: 2.5
This can counter a lot very efficiently, though not hitting most removal spells is a bummer.


Spell Pierce
AI Rating: 1.5
Pro Rating: 0
Even with a lot of Vehicles in this set this counterspell is too narrow.


Spikeshell Harrier
AI Rating: 4.2
Pro Rating: 4
Adding a 4/4 to the board and bouncing your opponent's best creature or vehicle is a big play, and this can even tamper with speed.


Stall Out
AI Rating: 1
Pro Rating: 1.5
Without Cycling this would be close to unplayable since it involves going down a card for some tempo, making it only good when you're ahead.


Stock Up
AI Rating: 3.6
Pro Rating: 2.5
This is a powerful draw spell for sure, but not adding to the board on turn three is pretty bad -- meaning this is more of a late game play.


Thopter Fabricator
AI Rating: 4.7
Pro Rating: 4.5
Blue has plenty of ways to get Thopter tokens out of this, and a big evasive Vehicle is pretty solid to begin with.


Trade the Helm
AI Rating: 2.5
Pro Rating: 1
Exchange effects are bad in Limited because it's very difficult to set up an exchange where you come out ahead, since you're the one who spent mana and a card on it.


Transit Mage
AI Rating: 4
Pro Rating: 0.0 // 3.0
If you have enough artifacts that cost 4 or 5, this'll feel pretty good. If you don't, you're not playing it.


Trip Up
AI Rating: 2.1
Pro Rating: 3
This 4-mana removal spell always ends up playing pretty well since it's a nice 1-for-1 trade, and this comes with Cycling upside.


Unstoppable Plan
AI Rating: 2.1
Pro Rating: 0
This effect is pretty useless in Limited.


Vnwxt, Verbose Host
AI Rating: 4.1
Pro Rating: 1
Blue is bad at max speed, and this card is awful if you don't have it.


Waxen Shapethief
AI Rating: 4.3
Pro Rating: 3.5
A Flash clone is nice, although this one can only copy your stuff, so you won't always have something worth 4 mana to copy.


Ancient Vendetta
AI Rating: 0.8
Pro Rating: 0
This type of card usually does nothing in Limited, and even when it does something, it isn't worth the mana or not adding to the board.


Back on Track
AI Rating: 3.3
Pro Rating: 2
This has some potential in this format, but the set up is a big deal and even with the Pilot tacked on you're not guaranteed to get your mana's worth.


Bloodghast
AI Rating: 3.3
Pro Rating: 2.5
It's nice it comes back for free so easily, but a 2/1 that can't block has limited uses in this Limited format.


Carrion Cruiser
AI Rating: 4.1
Pro Rating: 3.5
This is going to give you a 2-for-1 most of the time, and help with other graveyard and artifact synergies.


Chitin Gravestalker
AI Rating: 1.6
Pro Rating: 2
We've never seen a creature that is this specific about graveyard contents be super good in Limited. It won't be cheap enough often enough to be a card you really want, even in graveyard decks.


Cryptcaller Chariot
AI Rating: 4.4
Pro Rating: 4
Triggering this is very doable in Black and the baseline Vehicle is solid.


Cursecloth Wrappings
AI Rating: 4.6
Pro Rating: 3.5
This is a bit slow, but it's absolutely a game-winning value engine when you have the time to use it.


Deathless Pilot
AI Rating: 2.7
Pro Rating: 1.5
This is a fairly sub-par creature, and while returning to your hand can be nice, it's also just an effect you use when you have nothing better to do. Typically, you don't want to spend 6 mana to put a 2/2 in play.


Demonic Junker
AI Rating: 4.7
Pro Rating: 5
If this were always 7 mana it would probably be a 3.5 at worst, but it will frequently cost less! It adds a real vehicle to the board, kills your opponent's best thing, and gives you the option of sacrificing something to add counters to it. It's insane.


Engine Rat
AI Rating: 3.2
Pro Rating: 2.5
One mana 1/1s with death touch always punch above their weight-class, and this one even has some additional late game utility.


Gas Guzzler
AI Rating: 4.2
Pro Rating: 3
Starting engines on turn one is great, and this can help you raise your speed in a hurry. In the late game, it's a pretty nice sacrifice outlet.


Gastal Raider
AI Rating: 3.3
Pro Rating: 2
This enters trigger is going to whiff a little too often, and the baseline creature is very bad.


Gonti, Night Minister
AI Rating: 4.6
Pro Rating: 4.5
This effectively draws you a card for every creature that hits your opponent, while also giving you treasure. You do have to be wide enough or evasive enough to get in in the first place, but the effect tends to snowball, since the more cards you draw the more likely you can hit your opponent some more.


Grim Bauble
AI Rating: 3.9
Pro Rating: 3.5
This just gives you so much for only a single mana. It kills something up front and then provides all the artifact, sacrifice, and graveyard synergy you could ask for.


Grim Javelineer
AI Rating: 1.6
Pro Rating: 2
This stat-line doesn't perform well in formats where there are multiple one mana ways to kill three drops, and while the attack trigger makes up for it to a degree, it doesn't do enough for this to be a card that always makes the cut.


Hellish Sideswipe
AI Rating: 3.3
Pro Rating: 3
There are enough expendable bodies and artifacts in the format for this to feel pretty good. Even giving up a vehicle isn't bad since it gets replaced.


Hour of Victory
AI Rating: 1.8
Pro Rating: 2
Three mana 2/2 is bad, but in the late game this can potentially tutor up your best card.


Intimidation Tactics
AI Rating: 2
Pro Rating: 2.5
This kind of disruption is great early, but drops off late. You can just cycle it once it's useless, though.


Kalakscion, Hunger Tyrant
AI Rating: 2.4
Pro Rating: 1
The power is super high, but that doesn't do much to keep this from dying to lots of one mana cards, and with no other upside -- plus a challenging mana cost -- it's not a card you should play very often.


The Last Ride
AI Rating: 3.6
Pro Rating: 1
It's way too hard to get this to work in Limited, It's a dead card for a big chunk of the game, and sinking mana and life into this to draw cards is a recipe for disaster.


Locust Spray
AI Rating: 2.6
Pro Rating: 3
When this can kill something it feels great, and when it can't and you cycle it for a single Black mana, it's perfectly solid.


Maximum Overdrive
AI Rating: 2.3
Pro Rating: 2.5
This is a quality trick that blanks removal and wins virtually any creature combat against another creature.


Momentum Breaker
AI Rating: 3.3
Pro Rating: 3
This feels best on turn two when you use it to kill your opponent's only creature and attack with your one drop to rapidly raise your speed, but it does have some pretty seriously diminishing returns thereafter.


Mutant Surveyor
AI Rating: 2.3
Pro Rating: 2.5
The buff effect helps gets this in on many boards, and the fact you can exile it from your graveyard means it has 2-for-1 potential. Alternatively, it can feel pretty good when it gets milled too.


Pactdoll Terror
AI Rating: 3.7
Pro Rating: 3
A 4-mana 3/4 that drains 1 life when it enters is kind of passable, and this has a much higher ceiling than that thanks to being an artifact and draining life for every other artifact too. It's a good way to get max speed.


Quag Feast
AI Rating: 4.4
Pro Rating: 4
This is a great removal spell that scales all game long while also giving you some graveyard help.


Ripclaw Wrangler
AI Rating: 1.7
Pro Rating: 2
The vehicle you get here is pretty bad, and while I like making my opponent discard, it's less good on a card this expensive that doesn't always add to the board. I'd much rather have it on a two mana 1/1.


Risen Necroregent
AI Rating: 4
Pro Rating: 3.5
If you're good at getting max speed, this can be great. Problem is, even decks that are really good at getting max speed won't have it consistently enough for this to be completely insane -- instead, it's merely very good.


Risky Shortcut
AI Rating: 2.1
Pro Rating: 2.5
Making your opponent lose life while you draw cards is definitely a nice upgrade to this effect, and it helps with speed.


Shefet Archfiend
AI Rating: 2.7
Pro Rating: 1.5 // 3.0
If you're good at reanimating, this can be a pretty great target because of it's ability to add a real threat to the board while wiping a bunch of stuff away. 7 mana is too expensive to be what you pay for this all the time, though.


The Speed Demon
AI Rating: 5
Pro Rating: 5
There's a real chance this kills you if your speed is high enough, but between the cards he draws and the huge body, you're going to win before that happens most of the time. Valuing life gains a little more than normal is one way to offset this, too.


Spin Out
AI Rating: 4.2
Pro Rating: 3
It's a little expensive and a little hard to cast, but it answers most things in this format.


Streaking Oilgorger
AI Rating: 1.6
Pro Rating: 2
Even if this always had lifelink it wouldn't be insane, since the stat-line is pretty bad. Dying to lots of two mana card isn't where you want to be as a 5-drop.


Syphon Fuel
AI Rating: 2.2
Pro Rating: 2.5
This is never going to feel very efficient, and sometimes you have to trade down -- but it answers most things and the life gain can help offset the inefficiency.


Wickerfolk Indomitable
AI Rating: 2.1
Pro Rating: 2
A 4-mana 4/3 is nothing special, but if you have a decent number of expendable artifacts and creatures, being able to trade them in for a 4/3 is solid.


Wreckage Wickerfolk
AI Rating: 4.2
Pro Rating: 2.5
This is a solid two-drop. It's never goign to be a great creature, but the surveil helps improve draws in a big way while helping with graveyard synergy, and the artifact typing certainly matters.


Wretched Doll
AI Rating: 3.7
Pro Rating: 2.5
This can crew stuff pretty well and the artifact type is reasonably important in Black. Having to pay mana to Surveil isn't ideal, though.


Adrenaline Jockey
AI Rating: 2.6
Pro Rating: 3
This has a decent baseline, and getting counters on it isn't a big challenge. Keep in mind the 4 damage ability is symmetrical, though.


Boommobile
AI Rating: 4.6
Pro Rating: 5
The floor here is that you pay 4-mana for a 6/6 Vehicle with Crew 2 and you get to ping something. That's a great starting point, and the later the game goes, the more potent that Exhaust ability becomes.


Burner Rocket
AI Rating: 1.1
Pro Rating: 2
You're overpaying for the vehicle for sure, but the enters trigger has the potential to help a creature win combat and sometimes trample can help with speed.


Burnout Bashtronaut
AI Rating: 4.5
Pro Rating: 3
Starting your engines on turn one is great, and this is very capable of getting you to max speed quickly thanks to Menace.


Chandra, Spark Hunter
AI Rating: 4.8
Pro Rating: 4.5
The vehicles she makes aren't excellent at protecting her since you do need something around to crew them, but they certainly increase your chances of keeping her around. And that's good, because animating a vehicle every turn for free is big. Alternatively, her +2 can get you to her ultimate surprisingly quickly.


Clamorous Ironclad
AI Rating: 1.7
Pro Rating: 2
Casting this doesn't feel amazing, but there are board states where it's good. Cycling for only one mana really helps bail this out, though.


Count on Luck
AI Rating: 2.9
Pro Rating: 1.5
Triple Red is very hard to produce in Limited, and taking a turn off to cast this is a serious liability. It can definitely help you win a game with extra cards, but only if you can overcome those big downsides.


Crash and Burn
AI Rating: 2.6
Pro Rating: 3
It's definitely not very efficient, but it's relatively easy to cast and can kill most things that matter in the format.


Daretti, Rocketeer Engineer
AI Rating: 4
Pro Rating: 1
Daretti's enters/attacks trigger is really strong. But...red just isn't set up for Daretti to work out. You won't consistently have an artifact in play worth giving up or one in graveyard worth getting back.


Draconautics Engineer
AI Rating: 4.7
Pro Rating: 4.5
This feels good whenever it is you cast it, where it's on two or three, and then you use the other abilities later. Getting that dragon is where the most value is.


Dracosaur Auxiliary
AI Rating: 3.1
Pro Rating: 2.5
This isn't an ideally-sized creature for 6 mana, but saddling this is a pretty big deal as it can burn something out of the way often allowing it and other things to attack more effectively.


Dynamite Diver
AI Rating: 1.6
Pro Rating: 3
A one mana 1/1 that pings when it dies is a solid card in most Limited formats, and in this one it works especially nicely with Speed. Being able to crew above it's weight class is great too.


Endrider Catalyzer
AI Rating: 2.2
Pro Rating: 2.5
This doesn't have the most exciting Max Speed ability since by the time you get there it's unlikely you're desperate for mana. But it's a solid card by virtue of simply being a two drop with okay stats that can start your engines on turn two.


Endrider Spikespitter
AI Rating: 3.3
Pro Rating: 4
A 4-mana 3/4 with Reach is a passable baseline, and the max speed effect on this can win lots of games.


Fuel the Flames
AI Rating: 1
Pro Rating: 2
This is usually purely a sideboard card because it's difficult to set it up so that it hurts your opponent more than you, but because it has Cycling you can have access to this powerful effect in your main deck without it weighing you down too much.


Full Throttle
AI Rating: 2.5
Pro Rating: 0
Extra combat phases are only good when you've already got a good attack or you're really far ahead. In other words, this is a win-more card that is dead in all other situations.


Gastal Blockbuster
AI Rating: 2.3
Pro Rating: 2.5
This can give itself up to destroy an artifact, and if you have expendable stuff around it feels even better. It doesn't always have a target, but it has one often enough to be decent.


Gastal Thrillroller
AI Rating: 4.6
Pro Rating: 3
This hits pretty hard on turn three, and the fact you can get it back later is certain to give your opponent a headache. It adds so much trample damage to the board that it can really alter races out of nowhere.


Gilded Ghoda
AI Rating: 2.5
Pro Rating: 2.5
If you can get a treasure out of this and trade it off you're going to feel pretty good about stuff. If you can get more than one treasure out of it you'll feel great. And if you can't get any, it's going to feel kind of bad. Basically, this is really good on two, and less good thereafter.


Goblin Surveyor
AI Rating: 1.4
Pro Rating: 2.5
I don't love the stat-line, but trample + start your engines is a nice combination, and cashing this in for a card in mid to late game is very doable.


Greasewrench Goblin
AI Rating: 3.6
Pro Rating: 3.5
This feels pretty good on one, and it's exhaust ability is sure to not only make it a more relevant creature later, but also reload your hand while potentially triggering discard payoffs.

You really need Max Speed or this is an awful card. Sure, it can help you get to Max Speed with it's ability, but that ability is incredibly narrow. I think you can get to max speed enough in red for this to be good, but not so often that it's great.


Howlsquad Heavy

Pro Rating: 4
This new take on Goblin Rabblemaster is pretty sweet, and great at helping you raise your speed. Keep in mind you can use those goblins to crew in situations where you don't want to attack with them.


Kickoff Celebrations
AI Rating: 1.3
Pro Rating: 2
This is a Speed card that doesn't do much to help you get max speed, and Enchantment isn't a very useful type in this format. It's mostly just Tormenting Voice, which you play sometimes -- but certainly not all the time.


Lightning Strike
AI Rating: 4.1
Pro Rating: 4
It's very easy to trade up with this, and you can even finish your opponent off or raise your speed with it.


Magmakin Artillerist
AI Rating: 1.5
Pro Rating: 3
This is a nice way to raise your speed whether you cycle it or cast it, and it has a decent body.


Marauding Mako
AI Rating: 2
Pro Rating: 1.5 // 3.5
This is a great payoff if you're in the Blue/Red deck, which will have lots of ways to trigger this. It's going to be a lot less impressive in other Red decks, though.


Outpace Oblivion
AI Rating: 3.9
Pro Rating: 3.5
This is a fairly efficient removal spell, and it's nice that you can do some direct damage with it fairly often -- and raise your speed. Keep in mind the sacrifice ability is symmetrical, though.


Pacesetter Paragon
AI Rating: 2.2
Pro Rating: 2.5
This doesn't have a great baseline, but any time it attacks you put your opponent in an ugly spot, provided they don't have interaction.


Pedal to the Metal
AI Rating: 0.9

This is too inefficient to be a trick you play regularly, even with the pseudo-fireball upside.


Prowcatcher Specialist
AI Rating: 2.4

This won't feel that good on turn two, or on turn 4 when you can potentially buff it. But it never feels awful either.


Push the Limit

Yeah, you're not setting this up and then getting to 7 mana in Limited.


Reckless Velocitaur
AI Rating: 1.8

Hill Giant stats are bad, and while this Crew trigger is nice, the stuff it can crew can be crewed by lots of 2 drops in the format.


Road Rage
AI Rating: 4
Pro Rating: 4
One mana for two damage is a great deal, and this will usually be doing 3+ by the mid to late game.


Skycrash
AI Rating: 3.7
Pro Rating: 3.5
This will often have targets and just be a really good removal spell, and when it doesn't you can always cycle it.


Spire Mechcycle
AI Rating: 2.4
Pro Rating: 3.5
This looks very easy to Exhaust in Red. Provided you have another vehicle or mount, this will be a 5-mana 6/5 with Haste -- and if you have more than that (which is very possible) it'll be even bigger.


Thunderhead Gunner
AI Rating: 3.1
Pro Rating: 2.5
It's a little expensive, but this ability is pretty nice even in a vacuum. It gets better in a set with lots of discard payoffs.


Tyrox, Saurid Tyrant
AI Rating: 1.7
Pro Rating: 2
It's really good at crewing, and that's worth something in this format.


Afterburner Expert
AI Rating: 4.7
Pro Rating: 5
This can easily become a 6/4, and it can also very easily return to the graveyard since green has so much Exhaust. This thing coming back even once is usually going to spell doom for your opponent. The value is just insane.


Agonasaur Rex
AI Rating: 4.8
Pro Rating: 4.5
The combat trick mode is going to be really good in all kinds of situations and give you a 2-for-1 whether you win combat with it or blank removal, and obviously a 5-mana 8/8 trampler is an imposing board presence.


Alacrian Jaguar
AI Rating: 1.3
Pro Rating: 2
The base stats are bad, but it can very easily attack as a 6/6 with Vigilance, and that's not really a creature that can be ignored.


Autarch Mammoth
AI Rating: 4.2
Pro Rating: 4
6 mana is kind of a lot, but this certainly delivers with a 5/5 and 3/3 body, and you might even get more 3/3s!


Beastrider Vanguard
AI Rating: 3.2
Pro Rating: 2
This is a decent two drop, and the ability might be a little more accessible than in most formats since there are several cards that produce mana for abilities. However, only hitting a land with the ability is a very real outcome.


Bestow Greatness
AI Rating: 2
Pro Rating: 2
This has some serious blowout potential, but it's a little bit too expensive to be a great trick.


Broken Wings
AI Rating: 1.9
Pro Rating: 2
This has enough targets in the format for this to be main deck material, but it'll still be kind of a medium removal spell.


Defend the Rider
AI Rating: 2.4
Pro Rating: 2.5
This feels really good when it blanks removal or wins combat, and making a token with it isn't a bad failcase.


District Mascot
AI Rating: 4.6
Pro Rating: 3
This can get really out of control when you play it on turn one, and in the late game it has potential to turn into an Artifact removal spell, since you can just Saddle it, attack, and sacrifice it. That second option isn't amazing, but it's enough to keep this really good one drop relevant even when you draw it late.


Dredger's Insight
AI Rating: 3.6
Pro Rating: 2.5
Recursive spells like this have played pretty well lately, and I don't have incidental life gain stapled to it.


Earthrumbler
AI Rating: 4.4
Pro Rating: 3
Green decks will be pretty good at setting this up so that you don't have to crew very often, and it hits like a truck.


Elvish Refueler
AI Rating: 4.2
Pro Rating: 3.5
There are lots of good Exhaust abilities at lower rarities in the format, and rebuying them is pretty great. Even on it's own it can put a counter on itself every turn.


Fang Guardian
AI Rating: 3.8
Pro Rating: 2.5
This is a decent combat trick stapled to a creature, and it gives it some 2-for-1 potential, but I don't love the base stat-line.


Fang-Druid Summoner
AI Rating: 3.8
Pro Rating: 1.0 // 3.5
They put enough vanilla creatures in the set for this to actually tutor something up when you build around it. And if your'e getting the two mana 3/3 or the two mana 3/2, you're going to feel pretty good about it.


Greenbelt Guardian
AI Rating: 4.2
Pro Rating: 3.5
This has a passable baseline, and a 5/5 that can gain trample is going to be relevant all game long.


Hazard of the Dunes
AI Rating: 4.1
Pro Rating: 2.5
You're getting just about you should get for 4 mana, and in the late game it can become the biggest creature on the board.


Jibbirik Omnivore
AI Rating: 2.4
Pro Rating: 2
You get an on-rate creature here, but it doesn't do a whole lot more. If you have Fang-Druid Summoner or Rise from the Wreck, it gets a little better.


Loxodon Surveyor
AI Rating: 2.3
Pro Rating: 2.5
A three mana 3/3 is still okay, and this one is reasonably likely to give you a 2-for-1 later in the game.


Lumbering Worldwagon
AI Rating: 4.8
Pro Rating: 2
Crew 4 is a lot, especially if you play this early -- and a */4 gets a lot less impressive the later the game goes on. Sure, it's power will be higher, but that toughness staying at 4 still makes it super vulnerable. Meanwhile, the mana ramp just isn't very relevant most of the time.


March of the World Ooze
AI Rating: 4.8
Pro Rating: 4
This will make most boards way more impressive, and it even punishes your opponent for being able to remove it right away -- and they're going to want to, because it will often give you amazing attacks the turn you play it. It does ask you to have at least a few creatures, though.


Migrating Ketradon
AI Rating: 3.6
Pro Rating: 2.5
This is a solid top-end creature that is pretty good at helping you stabilize between the huge body, reach, and life gain.


Molt Tender
AI Rating: 3.4
Pro Rating: 3
This isn't as good as most one mana dorks because it typically won't be able to produce mana on turn two, but it does give you a nice mana boost on later turns, as well as fixing. And it can just set up graveyard stuff in general.


Ooze Patrol
AI Rating: 2.6
Pro Rating: 1.5
The floor here is a very bad creature, and the ceiling is a huge vanilla creature that still has a window where it is very vulnerable.


Oviya, Automech Artisan
AI Rating: 3.7
Pro Rating: 1.5
Oviya doesn't do enough to overcome her abyssmal stat-line. Her other abilities ask you to have things worth putting into play, and you'd be surprised how infrequently that's the case in Limited.


Plow Through
AI Rating: 4.2
Pro Rating: 3
Neither of these modes is that good individually, but when you CAN destroy a vehicle or creature for one mana, it feels pretty good.


Point the Way
AI Rating: 1.6
Pro Rating: 0
A Max Speed card that doesn't do anything to help you get there is super weird, and if you're spending your turn one not adding to the board and turn 4 grabbing some lands, you're probably going to lose.


Pothole Mole
AI Rating: 3.5
Pro Rating: 2.5
This gives some nice graveyard synergy and can even insure you hit a land drop.


Regal Imperiosaur
AI Rating: 4.5
Pro Rating: 3
This has above-rate states, and while dinosaurs aren't a huge theme in the set, there are a few that it can buff.


Rise from the Wreck
AI Rating: 3.5
Pro Rating: 1.5 // 3.0
If you're a graveyard-oriented deck with a good mix of Mounts and Vehicles, this'll be pretty good. It gets even better if you have a couple of vanilla creatures.


Run Over
AI Rating: 3.7
Pro Rating: 3.5
If this always cost two it would be a good card, but it will frequently only cost a single green, making it great. There's even a mount with death touch which makes for a particularly devastating combo.


Silken Strength
AI Rating: 1.5
Pro Rating: 1.5
The risk isn't really worth the reward here. The buff is fairly small, and Reach isn't exactly the most exciting keyword.


Stampeding Scurryfoot
AI Rating: 3.8
Pro Rating: 3.5
This is a very good Common. If it was always 5-mana for a 2/2 and a 3/3, you'd be pretty happy with that card -- but you can run this out on turn one and still have that upside for later in the game.


Terrian, World Tyrant
AI Rating: 3
Pro Rating: 1.5
I know the stat-line seems exciting, but it's just a big dumb creature that dies to a bunch of cheap removal. These days, you need a 5-drop to do something when it enters or dies to get around taht problem.


Thunderous Velocipede
AI Rating: 4.9
Pro Rating: 4.5
Getting lots of extra counters is a good way to gain a big advantage, and this can even rumble as a tramply vehicle when it has to.


Veloheart Bike
AI Rating: 2.8

If you're in the market for mana fixing and ramp, you could do worse. I'm just not sure how often you're going to want to play an understtated vehicle to gain access to that.


Venomsac Lagac

This can attack surprisingly well for most of the game, and it can of course always trade with anything. Particularly good with Run Over.


Webstrike Elite
AI Rating: 4.6
Pro Rating: 3.5
The Cycle mode can be a little pricey, but it's a Naturalize that draws you a card -- and that's a pretty good 2-for-1. And in the mean time, you can run it out as a very solid two mana 3/3 with Reach.


Aatchik, Emerald Radian
AI Rating: 4.6
Pro Rating: 5
You're not going to have much of a problem getting 3 tokens out of this, and that's absurd. It's just so many bodies out of a single card, and the ceiling is far higher than that.


Apocalypse Runner

This is a pretty clunky vehicle, but the activated ability can help you get max speed while also wreaking havoc on a race thanks to lifelink.


Boom Scholar

Reducing Exhaust costs is definitely relevant, and this has solid stats and a nice exhaust ability on top of that.


Boosted Sloop
AI Rating: 2.4
Pro Rating: 3.5
This triggers no matter what you attack with, so it often loots the turn it comes down. Looting is great on it's own, but you're also likely to have some payoffs to really take advantage of it.


Brightglass Gearhulk
AI Rating: 4.4
Pro Rating: 4.5
You're not going to cast this on turn 4 very often, but that's okay because a 4/4 with first strike and trample is a problem all game long, and it'll usually draw you at least one card -- and often it will draw you two.


Broadside Barrage
AI Rating: 3.7
Pro Rating: 4
This kills most stuff while giving you a very nice loot.


Broodheart Engine
AI Rating: 2.9
Pro Rating: 2.5
Not adding to the board on two is pretty bad, but this does give some real graveyard value and gives your deck the potential to bring back something huge for 4 mana.


Captain Howler, Sea Scourge
AI Rating: 4.3
Pro Rating: 4
A 4-mana 5/4 with this Ward is a pretty decent card, and this discard trigger is a huge deal, especially the card draw.


Caradora, Heart of Alacria
AI Rating: 4.2
Pro Rating: 4.5
This is a 4-mana 4/2 that's going to draw you a pretty good card, and Green/White has enough +1/+1 counter action for Caradora's triggered ability to be relevant pretty often.


Cloudspire Coordinator
AI Rating: 1.8
Pro Rating: 4
A two mana 3/1 with Scry 2 is such a good starting point, and once this isn't needed for crewing or attacking, it'll start spitting out 1/1s.


Cloudspire Skycycle
AI Rating: 2.7

As long as you have one other creature or vehicle, you're going to be happy with this enters trigger, and that's almost always going to be the case.


Coalstoke Gearhulk

The keywords make sure that whatever you get back with this is going to have an effective attack, and sometimes you'll get something great.


Debris Beetle

This enters trigger is powerful and can alter a race in a big way, and this is a pretty formidable attacker and blocker too.


Dune Drifter

It's hard to ever feel like you're getting a good deal with this, but by the mid-game it doesn't feel too bad.


Embalmed Ascendant
AI Rating: 2.8
Pro Rating: 4
The baseline of three mana for a 1/2 and a 2/2 is a very good Magic card, and in the later game this can make combat impossible for your opponent.


Explosive Getaway
AI Rating: 4

Sometimes you'll be able to save your best creature and destroy everything else, and that's great -- but 4 damage isn't quite enough to destroy everything on every board state.


Far Fortune, End Boss

This is great at getting you speed, which is good -- because it has a powerful Max Speed effect too.


Fearless Swashbuckler
AI Rating: 3.7
Pro Rating: 3
Even with this coming into play actually getting the card draw trigger is tough. The good news is a 3-mana 3/3 with Haste that gives your vehicles Haste is a good card anyway.


Gastal Thrillseeker
AI Rating: 3.6
Pro Rating: 3.5
Playing this on two gives you a very good shot at getting max speed in the near future, and sometimes it'll come down and give itself haste and death touch.


Guidelight Pathmaker

Tutoring up your best artifact is awesome, and if you're really in a pinch you can grab something that goes to the battlefield for free.


Haunt the Network
AI Rating: 3.7
Pro Rating: 3.5
The baseline is 5-mana for two 1/1 thopters and you drain your opponent 2 life. That's not good, but it's the baseline. Sometimes this will just end the game, and it will frequently turn the game on it's head.


Haunted Hellride

This attack trigger is really good, and the vehicle isn't too shabby.


Ketramose, the New Dawn
AI Rating: 3.7

There's not enough exile in this format for Ketramose to be attacking or blocking, and not enough to trigger the other effect either.


Kolodin, Triumph Caster
AI Rating: 4
Pro Rating: 3.5
If you play this on two it can allow for some insane curve outs, and even in the late game getting some free crews and saddles, not to mention haste, definitely matters.


Lagorin, Soul of Alacria
AI Rating: 3.4
Pro Rating: 3.5
If this comes down on schedule it's going to snowball and potentially runaway with the game. It's less impressive late, but the fact it can put counters on any mounts and vehicles will mean it's still pretty relevant.


Loot, the Pathfinder
AI Rating: 4.6
Pro Rating: 4.5
The mana's tough, but that's probably a good thing because a creature that can Lightning Bolt or Ancestral Recall is pretty insane in Limited. Ideally, you want to wait until you have that sixth mana to use one of those exhaust abilities before you play it.


Mendicant Core, Guidelight
AI Rating: 4.2
Pro Rating: 3
This can definitely have high power in blue-white decks, but getting to max speed and then also having artifacts to copy won't line up all that often.


Mimeoplasm, Revered One
AI Rating: 4.1
Pro Rating: 3
Once you are exiling two cards, this is a 5-mana 6/6 -- and it kind of scales from there, while maintaining the upside of transforming into the creatures it copies. It takes real set up, though, and it's pretty bad when you pay 1 for X.


Oildeep Gearhulk
AI Rating: -0
Pro Rating: 3.5
This trigger is nicely flexible. You can use it to help you loot, or to disrupt your opponent, and the body you get is pretty good.


Pyrewood Gearhulk
AI Rating: -0
Pro Rating: 4.5
It's tough to cast but it doesn't take much of a board state for this to break the game wide open. Vigilance + Menace + the buff is amazing, because it means you can swing super hard without giving up much on defense. So it isn't just good when it gives you lethal. It's basically always good when you cast it.


Rangers' Aetherhive
AI Rating: 3.9
Pro Rating: 3.5
The Vehicle itself is pretty nice, and getting just one thopter out of this feels good, and it isn't hard to build around.


Redshift, Rocketeer Chief
AI Rating: 3.8
Pro Rating: 3
His Exhaust ability is rarely useful in Limited. Even with the help he gives you, you're not going to have any permanents left by the time you can use it. But he's got solid stats and can help with other more meaningful Exhaust abilities.


Riptide Gearhulk
AI Rating: -0
Pro Rating: 4.5
This straight up removes something when it enters, and double strike and prowess make this a complete nightmare in combat.


Rocketeer Boostbuggy

This is just a ton of value for only two mana. Especially because it gives you mana back when it attacks.


Sab-Sunen, Luxa Embodied
AI Rating: 5
Pro Rating: 5
So the turn you play this you'll have a huge indestructible body protecting you, on the next turn you add a counter and draw two, and then on the next turn it can attack for 7. Basically you alternate between drawing lots of cards and having a huge creature, and those are great things to have.


Samut, the Driving Force
AI Rating: 4.1
Pro Rating: 4.5
She'll come down and give your board a buff of +1/+0 at a minimum, while also bringing a very powerful body to the board. Frequently she'll give your board a way bigger buff than that, too. The noncreature spell reduction isn't going to come up much, but that's okay.


Sita Varma, Masked Racer
AI Rating: 4.3
Pro Rating: 3.5
This ability is pretty tough to play against once your opponent has a bunch of mana, as it can make the board way scarier. Problem is, you do need a decent amount of mana before she's really a threat.


Skyserpent Seeker

This can trade with anything and the Exhaust ability is a great way to make sure you have mana for your other Exhaust abilities.


Thundering Broodwagon

Zahur, Glory's Past

Guidelight Matrix

Lifecraft Engine

This will almost always improve your board when it comes down since you can just name a type of creature you have in play, and it'll of course always buff vehicles.


Marketback Walker
AI Rating: 4.7
Pro Rating: 4.5
This is almost always going to net you cards, and if the game is stalled out you can just keep growing it and making into more of a threat as it becomes a more imposing creature on the board too.


Marshals' Pathcruiser
AI Rating: 2.7
Pro Rating: 1.5
I want this to be good, but paying 3 mana for a vehicle that is this hard to crew and hoping you'll be okay just seems like a very bad idea. Limited formats are just too slow these days.


Monument to Endurance

If you have a critical mass of cycling/discard, this is a legitimate value engine and win condition. Most decks won't be able to reach that critical mass, though.


Pit Automaton

Not adding to the board is very bad, and this Max Speed effect is rarely relevant in Limited.


Radiant Lotus

Starting Column
AI Rating: 1.8
Pro Rating: 1.5
It's rare for mana rocks that cost 3 to be worth it in Limited, because you want to add to the board on turn three pretty badly. The Max Speed effect does mean it isn't always a dead card, but you won't always get there.


Ticket Tortoise
AI Rating: 1.7
Pro Rating: 2
This crews and blocks decently enough, but it's the Treasure that is really intriguing here. Not only does it give you some mana and fixing, it can give you two artifacts for only two mana, something that many decks in the format are interested in.


Walking Sarcophagus
